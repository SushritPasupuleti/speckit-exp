# Feature Specification: QnA App for PDFs

**Feature Branch**: `001-description-a-simple`  
**Created**: 7 September 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A simple QnA app that accepts pdfs and allows for QnA, summaization and insight mining on them"

## Execution Flow (main)

```plaintext
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A user uploads a PDF document to the app, asks questions about its content, and receives accurate answers. The user can also request a summary or insights from the document.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a PDF is uploaded, **When** the user asks a question, **Then** the system provides an accurate answer.

2. **Given** a PDF is uploaded, **When** the user requests a summary, **Then** the system generates a concise summary of the document.

3. **Given** a PDF is uploaded, **When** the user requests insights, **Then** the system highlights key points and trends from the document.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the uploaded file is not a PDF?

- How does the system handle large PDF files?

- What happens if the user asks ambiguous or unclear questions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload PDF documents.

- **FR-002**: System MUST process and extract text from uploaded PDFs.

- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to ask questions about the content of the PDF and receive accurate answers.

- **FR-004**: System MUST generate summaries of the uploaded PDFs upon user request.

- **FR-005**: System MUST provide insights, such as key points and trends, from the uploaded PDFs.

- **FR-006**: System MUST handle errors gracefully, such as unsupported file formats or processing failures.

- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure data privacy and security for uploaded documents.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Document**: Represents the uploaded PDF, including metadata (e.g., title, size) and extracted content.

- **Question**: Represents a user query about the document content.

- **Insight**: Represents key points, trends, or summaries derived from the document.
